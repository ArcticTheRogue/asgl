# What is `asgl`?

`asgl` or Arctic's Simple Game Library is a script written in bash made for managing games.  I felt that you shouldn't have to use GUIs whenever you wanted to simply open a game so I made `asgl`.  `asgl` allows you to simply add, list, and play your games from it.

# Installation
Installation of `asgl` is very simple, all you need to do is move or copy it to your `$PATH` for example `/usr/local/bin`.

# Future Plans
-Add categorys

-Improve the list command

-Port to another language
