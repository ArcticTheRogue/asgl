# What is `asgl`?

`asgl` or Arctic's Simple Game Library is a script written in bash made for managing games.  I felt that you shouldn't have to use GUIs whenever you wanted to simply open a game so I made `asgl`.  `asgl` allows you to simply add, list, and play your games from it.

# Installation
Installation of `asgl` is very simple, all you need to do is move or copy it to your `$PATH` for example `/usr/local/bin`.

# How to use `asgl`
#### Adding games
To add a game type `a` and then follow the prompts.  First you will be asked to enter the name of the game, then the executable for the game, and finally you will be asked if you are sure if you want to add the game.  If you confirm your game will be added.

#### Listing games
To list your games simply type `l`, then you will get a list of the games you have added to `asgl`.

#### Playing games
To play a game simple type `p` and then when `asgl` asks you tell it the game you would like to play.

#### Removing games
If for whatever reason you wish to remove a game you can do so by typing `r`, and then following the prompts.  First you will be asked for the name of the game, and then to confirm that you want to delete it.  If you confirm then the game will be deleted from `asgl`.

# Future Plans
- Add categories

- Improve the list command

- Port to another language

- ~~Add the ability to import `.desktop` files~~ (I decided being able to import steam libraries was a better idea)

- Making it so games are listed with a number and you play them with this number

- Add the ability to import steam steam libraries
