# What is `asgl`?

`asgl` or Arctic's Simple Game Library is a script written in bash made for managing games.  I felt that you shouldn't have to use GUIs whenever you wanted to simply open a game so I made `asgl`.  `asgl` allows you to simple add, list, and play your games from it.

# Installation
Installation of `asgl` is quite simple.  First move `asgl` so it is in your `$PATH` for example `/usr/bin/`.  Then run `mkdir ~/.asgl-files/`, this will make a folder that `asgl` uses to store game information.  You can also use the install script which will do this for you.

# Future Plans
-Add categorys
-Improve the list command
-Port to another language
